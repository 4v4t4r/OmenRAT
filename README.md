    REMOTE ADMINISTRATION TOOL
    
OmenRAT is an open source remote administration tool. OmenRAT is written in python, and one of its goals is to be easily
extensible, and modifiable to suit your needs.

Goals:
 - Provide a stable and lightweight remote administration solution
 - Be as secure as possible, currently using AES256 encryption, more security features coming soon
 - Be easily extensible, with plugins written in python (maybe other languages, who knows)
 - Be cross-platform. My goal is to support Microsoft Windows, and Unix-based operating systems
 - Provide GUI, and command line interfaces for the OmenServer and OmenClient.
